## Statistical Data Mining

## Outline for the repository

## How linear regression parameters are estimated:
       Computational vs linear algebra approach.
## Five assumptions of regression models:
      Linearity.
      Multivariate normality.
      Homoscedasticity.
      Independence.
      Multicollinearity.
## How to test for these assumptions in R: 
      QQ-plots, residual plots, …
      Statistical tests: K-S test, Bartlett’s test, VIF, …
## How to correct for some violations of assumptions.
